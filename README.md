# students-database-management-JDBC-
DBMS project on students data management System [JDBC]
This is a miniproject to perform simple DML commands using JAVA.
Remember First we have to create database and all 3 tables used in the code using mysql commands or by phpmyadmin.
Eclipse software is used as editor and compiler.
Different classes had been taken for different tables and every table has its own separate class for getSet.
